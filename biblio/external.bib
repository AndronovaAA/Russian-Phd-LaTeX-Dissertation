	abstract = {Abstract The weighted incremental norm approach was originally introduced as a natural framework for extending well-known H∞ linear control concepts into the nonlinear context. In this paper, we investigate the numerous links between this new approach and the classical gain-scheduling technique. Although based on heuristic rules, gain-scheduled control is probably the most widespread nonlinear technique. In this paper, we point out that the control objectives of the gain-scheduled controller design can be expressed as the weighted incremental norm minimization of a nonlinear operator. The result interest is twofold: it first provides a rigorous mathematical formulation of the gain-scheduling problem. Furthermore, existing gain-scheduling techniques can be interpreted as approximate solutions to the weighted incremental norm minimization of a nonlinear operator.
